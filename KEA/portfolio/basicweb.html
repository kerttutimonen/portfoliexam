        <p>This task was to make a responsive website. Each of the students were given a theme, and the website was supposed to follow that specific style in terms of the display and content. The theme that was given to me was <b>"blue note"</b>. The website had to be responsive, have at least two breakpoints in css, use css grid on the layout and have a valid css that was put into an external stylesheet.</p>

      <p>The theme <b>blue note</b> was introduced to me already in previous projects (ADD LINK). I had already made a mood board and style sheet for the previous versions, but since along the way I had improved my skills, I wasn't fully satisfied with the looks and code anymore. I decided to change some things - although my website was still partly following the style I used to have. </p><br>
