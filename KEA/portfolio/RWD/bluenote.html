    <p>“Blue note means a note that is either sung or played at a different pitch than standard. It’s mostly used in jazz and blues.</p>

<p> One of the most common jazz songs with a blue note is ”Stormy Weather” by Harold Arlen.
    </p>
<p>The color blue has been used to symbolize sadness already back in 1300s. According to some sources, the first author to use the word ”blue” when writing about sadness was Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>

<p>For me, feeling blue is the feeling you get when you’re missing something - it could be old times, a person, a phase in your life. It includes sadness, but more than that, it’s the melancholic and wistful feeling you get when you’re longing for memories.</p>

<p>This can be also heard in jazz songs with the blue note. The songs are not necessarily sad, but they have this melancholic vibe in them. “Blue note” can also be defined as “a minor interval where a major would be expected”.
</p> 
   
   <p>The term <em>Blue Note</em> is also very much known in the popular culture. <b>Blue Note Records</b> is a jazz record label company established in 1939.</p>
   
   <p><b>Reid Miles</b> was an graphic designer, who is known for his work and design for the <em>Blue Note Records.</em> In the 1950s and 1960s he designed over 500 covers for them.  </p>
