    <main>
        <p> When designing the page, I've taken some influence from the iconic jazz record label <b>Blue Note Records</b> and their design - although I've also tried to adduce my own vision and understanding of the theme. For me personally blue note, as well as jazz, is also very much about the rather melancolic experience of <em>feeling blue</em>. The color blue is therefore also very symbolic.


        </p>


        <p>The design process started by creating a moodboard of the theme.</p><br>

       <img src="images/moodboard.png" alt="moodboard" class="moodboard"><br>
           
            <p>
            <i>The moodboard</i></p>

        <p>After the moodboard </p>


        <img src="images/colors_new.jpg" alt="colors" class="colors1"><br>
           <p> <i>The first version of a color scheme based on the moodboard</i></p>



       <img src="images/colors.png" alt="colors" class="colors2">
             <p> <i>The final version of the color scheme including the colors that are used in the final version</i></p>

        <p>

            The chosen typography is <i>Georgia</i> (font-family: Georgia, Times, "Times New Roman", serif). I chose this since I find it "old school" enough - and therefore it fits well with the theme.

        </p>

        <p>The html-files, css-sheet and images are located inside a folder called "RWD". The images of the website are inside a sub-folder called "images".</p>


       <img src="images/folders.jpg" alt="folders" class="folders"><br>

           <p> <i>The content inside the main folder. </i><br></p>

        <p>The website is coded and designed to be usable and responsive on both mobile devices and desktop screen. I chose those two options, since they are pretty much the most common ones and I'm most familiar with them myself.</p>

       <img src="images/mobile.PNG" alt="mobile" class="mobile"><br>

            <p> <i>The website on a mobile device (iPhone 6s).</i></p>

       <img src="images/desktop.png" alt="desktop" class="desktop"> <br>

            <p> <i>The desktop version of the website.</i></p>


        <img src="images/large.jpg" alt="assets" class="assets1"><br><br>
                <img src="images/small.jpg" alt="assets" class="assets2">
