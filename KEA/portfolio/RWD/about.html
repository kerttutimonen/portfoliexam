         <p>I moved to Copenhagen from Helsinki in 2017 and there hasn’t been a single day when I’ve regretted this decision. I started by studying Bachelor Program In Social Sciences but in February 2019 I changed school to study Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA.</p>

<p>Starting at KEA is another decision I don’t regret! I’ve learnt some of the basics of HTML/CSS coding when I was in primary school, but later on forgot a lot about it. Now I’m looking so much forward to my future studies, there’s so much I want to learn!</p>

<p>Besides coding I really enjoy visual things in the digital world. I could use Instagram as an example of this - I love saving pictures with nice colors to the folder only I can see, and just go scroll down through it every once in a while.</p>

<p>I’m also interested in marketing, and I’m currently working as a part-time junior in a digital marketing agency, mostly with SEO and PPC. Other things that interests me are for example branding, fashion, nature and vegan food.</p>
