    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p>Welcome to take a look at my portfolio. I am studying <b>Multimedia Design and Communication</b> at KEA - Københavns Erhrevsakademi (Copenhagen School of Design and Techonology), and going to finish my first semester in June 2019. This portfolio consists of different assignments and projects that I've been doing during the first semester. It is divided into different themes: <b>Basic Web, Basic Animation, Basic Content and Basic UX</b> and inside the themes you can find the different projects that are part of each theme, as well as the decriptions of the themes. </p>

    <p> During the first semester I have gotten a good basic knowledge and skills in basic HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as in design, mainly using different programs provided by Adobe. In the projects of this portfolio I have mainly used Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD and Premiere Pro.

                <h3>Theme 01: Basic Web</h3>

                <p>
                    In the first theme of this semester, Basic Web, the main focus was on the interface design, user testing and responsive web design. I got a good basic knowledge of the basic HTML and CSS and in addition to the coding part, we were introduced to Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. </p>

                <p>

                    The theme covered the tools of creating a basic website step by step - first doing some research and collecting the content, making a prototype, user testing it and coding it into a functioning website. The design part of the theme was built from creating a mood board to designing and styling the final website, which also gave me a good first touch with Photoshop.
                </p>



                <h4>01.01.02 Project Document</h4>

                <p>The project document includes e.g. my mood board for the theme and the first vision and ideas I had for the future website. I learned the phases of starting a website and understood how important it is to have a well-structured plan and idea of (in this case) of a website before starting to build the actual website.

                    <h4>01.04.01 Responsive Web Design</h4>


                    <p> The task was to code a website using HTML and CSS, that has at least two breakpoints in CSS. My website is responsive in mobile devices and desktops. The design and looks of my website follows a theme that was given to me - Blue Note - and is also inspired by the previous documentation I had made based on the theme. </p>

                    <p>An important rule was to learn how to use the CSS media queries that make the website usable and to look good in different devices. My website is responsive and tailored for mobile devices and desktops.</p>

                    </form>



                    <h3>Theme 02: Basic Animation</h3>

                    <p>The second theme, Basic Animation, consisted of the basic Javascript, making animations by using CSS and adapting Javascript into that, character design and storytelling. At the end of the theme we had group work and a project that was also a conclusion of the skills we had improved during this theme period.</p>




                    <h4>02.02.01 Week submission _part one_part two_part three </h4>

                    <p>This task was done in three different parts -first I wrote the logline of the story and drew a storyboard, then the I created a style tile and worksheet. The final phase was to create the sprite sheet and make it move by using CSS. This task included a lot of practise with Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                        <h4>02.04.06 Link to Final Interactive Production</h4>



                        <p>This project was done in groups. The link below takes you to the final product. This website is an user-interactive animation that includes different CSS animations, Javascript interactions and sound effects. The design of the page is hand-made in the group. My own focus was on the coding part, and this task gave me a good introduction e.g. for the Javascript add.Event.Listener method that made it possible to make the animation clickable, for example the different scene of the animation starts when the user clicks the "Let's go" button.</p>



                        <p>Our animation is based on the classic movie <em>Taxi Driver</em>, directed by Martin Scorsese (1976). </p>

                    <h4>02.04.07 Presentation</h4>

                    <p>
                        A documentation of the process of making the Taxi Driver animation. It includes those documents we created (for example the moodboard) and later on used as an inspiration for the animation. The storyboard is a sketch of the final interactive animation.

                    <h3>Theme 03: Basic Content</h3>

                    <p>The third theme guided me to develope concepts by using videos, film language and different media elements. The main focus was on producing content for different digital media platforms. </p>

                    <h4>03.02.01 Team Canvas</h4>

                    <p>Together with my group we filled out the team canvas. It turned out to be a great conclusion of our roles in a group and our common and individual goals with this project. We also discussed about our strenghts and weaknesses and after filling it out we had a clear direction for the upcoming project. </p>

                    <h4>03.02.03 Storyboard</h4>



                    <p>The storyboard was made for the video. This task was done in groups. The storyboard illustrates the plot our video that is included to our website "Copenhagen by bike". It communicates shot sizes, image composition, angles, transitions, props and sound.</p>

                    <h4>03.02.05 Link to site</h4>


                    <p><b>Bicycle guide for non-Danes.</b> The task was to create a website with information and an instructional video about the biking rules in Copenhagen. The long-term goal of the website is to make the visitors (as well as the locals) aware of the rules, so that the biking environment is safe and the traffic moves smoothly. <br></p>


                    <p>Both of the website and the video were done in groups. Together with my group we filmed the video by biking around the city. The website follows the Design Guide given by The Copenhagen Municipality (Københavns Kommune). This was a first time we needed to create a website based on a design guide of a client. </p>

                    <p> The target group of our website is the mainly the people our own age (young adults). This can be seen also in the tips we're giving on the website, for example the places that are worth visiting.

                    <h3>Theme 04: Basic UX Design</h3>

                    <p>The last theme of this semester had a focus on users and user interfaces. UX design consists of knowing the needs of the user and applying them to the websites of different clients and companies while still making sure that the business/purpose of the company remains the same.</p>

                    <h4>04.01.01 Design Sprint</h4>


                    <p>The design sprint contains documentation of the work process of our group. It includes the phases of mapping, sketching, deciding, prototyping and testing documented and explained. At the end of the document there's a link to the XD prototype.</p>

                    <h4>04.02.01 Web Prototype</h4>


                    <p>
                        The project document of the coded web prototype. The document includes the link to the final product. The coded web prototype was done individually, and included also an UI animation, forms and Javascript. The website is responsive. In the process of this web prototype I applied a lot of important things in terms of the methods of UX design, such as prototyping, testing and analysing the results of the tests.

        <h2>About me, Kerttu.</h2>

        <p>

            As I was walking down the streets of Copenhagen, back in 2016, I realized that I <i>had</i> to move here. The thought of moving to Copenhagen didn’t go away from my head, and luckily my dream became reality the following summer. And yeah, after two years I’m still here with <i>zero</i> regrets or no plans of moving anywhere else. </p>


        <p>I’m a 22 years old student from Finland, born and raised in Helsinki. Helsinki is also a city that I love very much, and it definitely makes it easier to live abroad knowing that it is only one hour away by plane. Although, I’ve never really felt that homesick during the time I’ve lived here in Denmark - I guess I don’t really have time for that since I’m too busy exploring and being inspired of the city I currently live in.</p>

        <p>Another thing that keeps me busy is my every day life here that includes both studying and working. I study Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA (Københavns Erhvervsakademi) and work as a part-time junior in a digital marketing agency, doing SEO and PPC tasks for different clients. I’m really happy about my current study/working situation and <i>when I grow up</i> I would love to continue working in the digital field, most preferably with digital marketing. I really enjoy coding and I’m very motivated of providing my skills and knowledge. I actually learned the very basics of HTML and CSS already when I was in the primary school when I was coding websites for my imaginary horse stables (trust me, it was a thing back then).</p>


        <p>During my free time I love to bike around in Copenhagen, spend time with my friends, cook vegan food, go for runs outside and shop new clothes, although it’s not very suitable hobby for my student budget and also fights against the fact that I would actually like to consume as little as I can. Well, I guess you can also go shopping without buying anything?
